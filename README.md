# 👋 Hi, I'm Ralph – UX Designer, Systems Thinker & Digital Tinkerer

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.\
This website isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a personal interface to the world.

## 🧠 Who I Am

I'm a UX designer driven by clarity, systems thinking, and the belief that
digital products should feel less like tools and more like second nature.

My focus:

- Designing UX for complex digital ecosystems
- Bridging design quality and technical feasibility
- Prototyping, testing, iterating — without the buzzword nonsense

## 🌐 Why This Website?

In a sea of cookie-cutter templates, algorithmically-filtered feeds, and "UX =
UI" misconceptions, I wanted a space that’s fully mine. No dark patterns. No
noise. Just me — in HTML, CSS, and some honest TS.

This site has three purposes:

1. **Self-clarity** – Good UX starts with knowing who you are. This is me,
   trying to practice what I preach.
1. **Sandbox** – Design is never done. This is my live testbed for ideas,
   patterns, and provocations.
1. **Conversation starter** – If you’ve read this far, you're probably someone I
   want to talk to. Reach out.

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

- Thoughts on design, tech, ethics, and the messy overlap between them
- Selected projects that show how I think and work (maybe later)
- Occasional rants, sketches, and UX experiments (maybe later)

## 🤔 Still Curious?

Drop me a message or follow a link.\
I don't always reply immediately, but I do reply thoughtfully.

leaving nothing to add, subtract, or improve."_
